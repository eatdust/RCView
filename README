RCView is a flightgear addon setting-up an additional view which
mimics the vision of a pilot remote controlling a plane.

The RC pilot looks at the plane at all times and remains
still. A configuration menu allows you to set your height and
the distance at which you start remote controlling the target.

During the flight, you can however jump to another location,
extrapolated to be nearby the plane, by pressing Alt-V while the "RC
View" is active. This might be useful if you have miserably lost sight
of your model or shamelessly crashed it in a nearby field.
